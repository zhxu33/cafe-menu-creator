# Coding Challenge: Cafe Menu Creator

## Challenge

Write a simple HTML form for creating a cafe menu.

You may use any frontend programming language and framework you wish, e.g. Javascript, Typescript, React, Vue, etc. No backend code is expected for this challenge.

You are provided a JSON file (menu.json), containing example json like the output expected from your form code.

You may _not_ use the Internet to look up the answers to this test but you _can_ use the Internet for regular
programming queries, e.g. how do I use map() in my programming language? (Just like you would at work.)

## Specifications

1. The form you write must have three fields. One for the item name, a second for the item price, and a third for the kind of item. The item kind must be one of three options ('drink', 'food' or 'other').

2. There should also be a button to add the currently-entered item into the list and prepare the form to accept another item.

3. Finally, there should be a "Submit" button that outputs json for the menu items that were added using the form. The json can either be displayed or logged to the console.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on:

- Correctness of the output (does the format of your output match the format of the provided menu.json?)
- Cleanliness of code
- Readability of code
- General programming competencies, e.g. clean architecture, DRY code, etc.

If you cannot finish the allotted time please still turn in a response. Incomplete responses may still be evaluated.
